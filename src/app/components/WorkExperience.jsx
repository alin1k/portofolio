My tasks include adding features, fixing bugs, and optimizing code. Iâ€™ve developed both front-end and back-end components. I learned how to collaborate with my team in order to meet requirements and deadlines.</p>

        <p className="mt-2 leading-4 font-extralight">I have taught kids different IT concepts, from basic computer usage for younger children, to programming games using logical blocks (Scratch). For older kids, I introduced more advanced programming topics such as data structures (lists, matrices, recursive functions) in JavaScript and Python. Through this experience, I developed the ability to explain complex concepts in simple terms and skills in debugging and understanding code written by others.</p>
