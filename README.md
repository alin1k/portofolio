# Portofolio 

This is my portofolio webpage. All my projects are fetched from my GitHub profile using the GitHub API. Projects are displayed only if they are labeled as `featured-project'

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
